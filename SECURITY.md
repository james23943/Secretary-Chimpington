## Security Best Practices

While using this project, please consider the following security best practices:

- **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update your dependencies to incorporate the latest security patches.
- **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive information, such as API keys and tokens, in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your code.
