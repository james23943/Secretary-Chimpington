Use channels for their intended purposes to keep the server organized and enjoyable for everyone.\n\n3. Refrain from asking for admin, moderator, or monitor roles. Let leadership roles be earned or appointed organically.\n\n4. Ensure your self-roles are correctly set to reflect your preferences or identity in the server.\n\n5. Avoid actions or conversations that could create division within the community.\n\n6. Address dramas openly and constructively in a way that promotes resolution and understanding.\n\n7. Be mindful of others' wellbeing and avoid actions or comments that could harm someone else (within reason).\n\n8. Respect people's stated boundaries, including their age and DM preferences.\n\n9. Be cautious about inviting others. If someone exhibits significant warning signs (\"walking red flags\"), consider the impact on the server before extending an invitation.",
